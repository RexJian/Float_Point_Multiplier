# Float_Point_Multiplier
Design a pipeline multiplier for floating-point numbers and complete the APR, passing the Calibre DRC/LVS checks. Additionally, ensure there are no timing violations in the post-layout gate-level simulation. The timing constraint of the circuit is <strong>0.3 ns</strong>, so for the most time-consuming part, which involves multiplying two 53-bit numbers, use the ChipWare component IP. This component divides the multiplication process into several cycles. Finally, I applied power optimization methods to reduce power consumption from<strong> 10.8 mW to 9.17 mW.</strong>

Based on IEEE 754 standard, the double precision are stored in 64 bits: 1 for the sign, 11 for the exponential, and 52 for the fraction. An exponent is an unsigned number represented using the bias method with a bias of 1023. The fraction represents a number less than 1,
